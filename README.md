# Time Series Forecast
How to predict the future ? Mathematical R functions allows to get characteristics as seasonality, trend, and most important the correlation between values into a dataset to predict what will happen in the future.

This project is made from some time series dataset studies in R :
- How the dataset can be exploited to forecast future values ?
- How to create train and test dataset to train our model
- How to choose the proper model which give us the best prediction

That's not magic, that's just science :)
